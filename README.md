# Groceries
Terminal flavored grocery web app using local storage and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Created for fun because I wanted to design and build my own grocery list. To check out and use the app, please visit [groceries.jaimefarnan.com](https://groceries.jaimefarnan.com/).

## Run the app
In the terminal, run `npm i` or `yarn` to install packages. Then: `npm start` or `yarn start`

### Adding items
It may not be readily apparent, but when creating a new item, you can tap the *Wegmans* logo to switch between *Wegmans* and *Costco* - the two main grocery stores I frequent...they are the best.
